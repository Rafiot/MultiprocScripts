Multiprocessing Scripts
=======================

This is a bunch of scripts I use to multiprocess stuff.

multiproc_dir.py
================

It allows you to run a script on all the files of a directory, controls the
amount of processes running at the same time and tells you whn it's finished.

See the test/ directory for an example.
